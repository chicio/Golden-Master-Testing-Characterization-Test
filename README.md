An example java project created for my blog post ["Golden master testing aka Characterization test: a powerful tool to win your fight against legacy code"](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/03/20/golden-master-test-characterization-test-legacy-code.html "Golden master testing aka Characterization test: a powerful tool to win your fight against legacy code").

### Description

The app contains an example of the Golden Master testing technique.
Below an article quote:

>  In computer programming, a **characterization test (also known as Golden Master Testing)** is a means to describe
(characterize) the actual behavior of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behavior of
legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. This term was coined by **Michael Feathers**...... When
creating a characterization test, one must observe what outputs occur for a given set of inputs. Given an
observation that the legacy code gives a certain output based on given inputs, then a test can be written that
asserts that the output of the legacy code matches the observed result for the given inputs.
